Summer Research Project on Computer Vision Algorithm for Axonal Fragment Detection and Measurement

## Project Overview

This research project aims to develop a computer vision algorithm to detect and measure the lengths of axonal fragments. Axonal damage is a critical factor in various neurological conditions, and accurately quantifying axonal fragmentation can significantly enhance the understanding and diagnosis of these conditions. Over the summer of 2024, we designed and implemented algorithm that can efficiently process microscopy images of axons, identify fragments, and measure their lengths.

## Objectives

1. **Literature Review**: 
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of existing methods for axonal fragment detection and measurement.
   - Identify the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches to inform the development of our algorithm.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather a dataset of microscopy images of axons, including images with known fragment lengths for validation.
   - Implement preprocessing steps to enhance image quality and facilitate accurate detection, such as noise reduction.

3. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Design a computer vision algorithm to detect axonal fragments in the preprocessed images.
   - Implement segmentation techniques to isolate individual fragments from the background.
   - Develop a method for accurately measuring the lengths of the detected fragments.

4. **Optimization and Refinement**:
   - Optimize the algorithm for performance, focusing on reducing computation time and improving detection accuracy.
   - Refine the algorithm based on feedback from initial testing and validation results.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the development process, including the methodology, algorithms used, and results obtained.

## Milestones

1. **Week 1-2**: Conduct literature review and finalize project objectives.
2. **Week 3-4**: Preprocess the dataset.
3. **Week 4-7**: Develop the initial version of the detection algorithm.
4. **Week 7-8**: Implement measurement techniques and integrate them with the detection algorithm.
5. **Week 8-9**: Refine the algorithm based on validation results and prepare the final documentation and report.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: OpenCV, scikit-image, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Expected Outcomes

- A robust and efficient computer vision algorithm for detecting and measuring axonal fragments.
- A comprehensive evaluation of the algorithmâ€™s performance on a validation dataset.
- Detailed documentation of the research process and findings.
- Potential publication of the research results in a relevant scientific journal or conference.

## Future Work
While progress was made in detecting axonal fragments in microscopy images of optic nerves, further evaluation and validation of the computer algorithm performance is necessary.
This evaluation includes fine-tuning computer algorithm parameters, improving efficiency, and validation of results.
